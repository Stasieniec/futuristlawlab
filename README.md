# Futurist Law Lab

Official website for Futurist Law Lab, a student initiative based in Amsterdam that engages youth to shape the future of law in the age of technological advancement.

## Our Mission

Our mission is twofold:
1. Engage youth to future-proof the law
2. Show people that law is alive, exciting, and ever-changing

We believe that while law often lags behind technological developments, it does not have to be that way. We promote smart lawmaking, inclusive legislative processes, and aim to be the voice of youth in legal discussions.
